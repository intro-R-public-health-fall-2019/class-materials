In Module 3, we are learning about "data wrangling", which is the process of getting data into `R` and into the right format for making graphs and doing statistical analyses.  In Class 3-2, we will learn about the principles of *tidy data* and functions that can be used to put data into this format.  We will use the `tidyr` package to do this.  The `tidyr` package is part of the `tidyverse`.

*Note:* These class activities are adapted from "R for Data Science" by Grolemund and Wickham, chapter 12.  You can find this chapter [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)

Load the `tidyverse` group of packages to have access to `tidyr`.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Tidy data

The same data can be represented in many different formats.  Consider a data set which contains the number of tuberculosis (TB) cases documented by the World Health Organization (WHO) in Afghanistan, Brazil, and China for the years 1999 and 2000.  We could organize this data in four different ways:

```{r}
table1
```

```{r}
table2
```

```{r}
table3
```

```{r}
table4a
table4b
```

All of these tables contain the same underlying data, but some are easier to use (analyze, display) than others.  In general (although not absolutely always!) it is easiest to work with data that is in a **tidy** format.  Tidy data satisfies three rules:

1. Each variable must have its own column
2. Each observation must have its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell

Here's a visual representation of these rules from "R for Data Science" by Grolemund and Wickham, chapter 12:

![](tidy_data_figure_R4DS.png)

To summarize these three rules into an easy rule of thumb: **PUT EACH VARIABLE INTO ITS OWN COLUMN**

Which of the above four representations of the TB data would be considered tidy? **table1**

When data is in a tidy format, we can use the other functions/packages in the `tidyverse` easily:

* Calculate a disease rate per country per year:
```{r}
table1 %>%
  mutate(rate = cases/population*10000 )
```

* Calculate a total number of cases per year across the countries:
```{r}
table1 %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(nCases = sum(cases))
```

* Graph changes over time by country:
```{r}
table1 %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = cases, color = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

## Practice

How could we calculate the disease rate per country per year using the other tables?

## Common problems with untidy data

Two common problems with non-tidy data are:

1. One variable is spread across multiple columns
2. One observation is scattered across multiple rows

We can fix these problems using the `gather()` and `spread()` functions in `tidyr`.

# Gathering columns into a new pair of variables

Problem 1 (one variable is spread across multiple columns) can happen when some of the column names are not *names* of variables but *values* of variables instead:

```{r}
table4a
```

Here `1999` and `2000` are actually values of a `year` variable rather than variables themselves!  So each row of this dataset contains two observations instead of only one!

To make this dataset tidy, we need to **gather** these columns together into a new pair of variables where one gives the `year` of the observation and the other gives the `cases` of the observation. 

```{r}
table4a %>%
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

The general format here is to first list the columns we want to gather (`1999`, `2000`) and then give the names of the two new variables we want.  The `key` is the variable whose values form the column names and the `value` is the variable whose values are spread across the original columns.

Here's a visual representation from "R for Data Science" by Grolemund and Wickham, chapter 12:

![](tidy_data_gather_R4DS.png)

## Practice

1. Why doesn't this code work?
```{r eval=FALSE}
table4a %>%
  gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

2. How could you gather the data in `table4b` in a similar way?
```{r eval=FALSE}
table4b %>% 
  
```

3. We can then join `table4a` and `table4b` together using the `left_join()` function from the `dplyr` package:
```{r eval=FALSE}
tidy4a <- table4a %>%
    gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
  
tidy4b <- table4b %>%

left_join(tidy4a, tidy4b)

```

# Spreading a column into two new columns

Problem 2 (one observation is scattered across multiple rows) can happen when a column contains values for more than a single variable:

```{r}
table2
```

Here the `count` column contains values for both the number of cases *and* the population. 

To make this dataset tidy, we need to **spread** this column into two columns instead, so that we will have a column for `cases` and a separate column for `population`. 

```{r}
table2 %>%
  spread(key = "type", value = "count")
```

The general format here is that the `key` is the column that designates the names of the two variables we want to separate and the `value` is the column  that contains the values of those two variables.

Here's a visual representation from "R for Data Science" by Grolemund and Wickham, chapter 12:

![](tidy_data_spread_R4DS.png)
The `gather()` and `spread()` functions are complements to each other.  `gather()` makes wide tables narrower and longer and `spread()` makes long tables shorter and wider.

## Practice

1. Tidy the data below.  Do you need to spread or gather it?  What are the variables?

```{r}
preg <- tribble(
  ~pregnant, ~male, ~female,
  "yes",     NA,    10,
  "no",      20,    12
)

preg
```

2. Tidy the data below.  Do you need to spread or gather it?  What are the variables?

```{r}
characteristics <- tibble(
  name   = c("Ann","Ann","Barbara","Barbara"),
  measure  = c("age", "height",  "age", "height"),
  value = c(45, 67, 32, 60)
)

characteristics
```


# Separating and uniting

In addition to the two common problems discussed above, we can also have non-tidy data because:

1. A single cell contains two values
2. A single value is spread across multiple cells (pretty rare!)

We can fix these problems using the `separate()` and `unite()` functions in `tidyr`. 

## Splitting a cell with `separate()`

The `separate()` function pulls apart one column into multiple columns by splitting on a designated separator character:

```{r}
table3
```

For tidy data, we should separate the numerator and demoninator of the `rate` variable into separate columns called `cases` and `population`.  We can use the character `/` to separate these two values.  We tell the function the names of the two new variables we want and the character that separates them:

```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep="/")
```

Here's a visual representation from "R for Data Science" by Grolemund and Wickham, chapter 12:

![](tidy_data_separate_R4DS.png)


Now if we wanted to, we could create that quantitative `rate` variable in a more meaningful way using mutate!  But why won't this work?

```{r eval=FALSE}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep="/") %>%
  mutate(rate = cases/population)
```

How can we fix this?  All of the functions we've seen so far in this class (`separate()`, `gather()`, and `spread()`) have a `convert` option that will attempt to convert the new columns it's creating to the appropriate type (like parsing when we learned about data import). We can try that here:

```{r eval=FALSE}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep="/", convert = TRUE) 

table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep="/", convert = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(rate = cases/population)
```

## Practice

1. What's the difference between these two chunks of code?
```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep="/")

table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep="/", remove=FALSE)
```

2. Can you figure out what happens when we give `sep` a number instead of a character?
```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(year, into = c("century", "year"), sep=2)

table3 %>% 
  separate(country, into = c("abbrev", "extra"), sep=3)
```

## Combining cells with `unite()`

The inverse of `separate()` is `unite()`, which combines multiple columns into a single column.  This isn't a very common thing to do, but it's nice to know this tool exists!  For example, suppose we had were starting with the data set where we split year into century and year:
```{r}
table_century <- table3 %>% 
  separate(year, into = c("century", "year"), sep=2)

table_century
```

But we wanted to combine these two columns back together into a single column:

```{r}
table_century %>% 
  unite(new, century, year, sep = "")
```

Here's a visual representation from "R for Data Science" by Grolemund and Wickham, chapter 12:

# Case study

Here's a more complicated example of tidying data in practice!  The following data contains TB data from the WHO broken down by country, year, age, gender, and diagnosis data.  This is a very messy dataset, but we can use the tools in the `tidyr` package to put it in tidy format!

```{r eval=FALSE}
who

View(who)
```

What variables do we see?

* `country`, `iso2`, and `iso3` all give the country
* `year` gives the year 
* A column like `new_sp_m014` must give us some information about the age, gender, and diagnosis.  

In fact, if we looked at the data dictionary (codebook) for this data set, we would learn that these variable names are coded in the following way:

* the first 3 letters of the variable name tell us whether these are new or old cases of TB
* the next 2 letters describe the type/diagnosis of TB (`rel` = relapse, `ep` = extrapulmonary, `sn` = smear negative, `sp` = smear positive)
* the sixth letter give the sex (`m` = males, `f` = females)
* the remaining numbers give the age group (`014` = 0-14 years old, etc)

So these variable names contain values of variables, so we will need to gather them into a new variable.  We will also remove all the missing values at this point to make the data set easier to work with.
```{r}
who1 <- who %>% 
  gather(new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, key = "key", value = "cases", na.rm = TRUE)
who1
```

Now we can see that this key column contains the values of multiple variables: `new`, `type`, `sex`, and `age`.  We can split across these values using the `separate()` function.  One thing we need to fix first, though, is a typo in the names for the `rel` type.  The `_` symbol is missing so it reads `newrel_m014` instead of `new_rel_m014`.  We will fix that now before we proceed; this isn't something you would know how to do yet in our class:
```{r}

who1 %>%
  group_by(key) %>%
  summarize(n=n()) %>%
  as.data.frame()

who2 <- who1 %>% 
  mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel"))
who2
```

Now we can separate the `key` column across the `_` character to split into `new`, `type`, and `sex_age` columns:
```{r}
who3 <- who2 %>% 
  separate(key, into = c("new", "type", "sex_age"), sep = "_")
who3
```

Finally, we can separate the `sex_age` column into just `sex` and `age`:
```{r}
who4 <- who3 %>% 
  separate(sex_age, into = c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)
who4
```

Now we have tidy data!  Check that each variable has its own column, each observation has its own row, and each value has its own cell.

We could do this whole process at once without saving the intermediate dataset using the pipe.  What would that look like? 
```{r}


```
